Mr. Bobtail Fitz-Herbert Bunnikins-Bunny
was a very
great dandy, for not only
had he his own beautiful white fur
coat, but he wore the finest of
other clothes besides. His feathered
hats, his fine coats, his lovely neckties,
and his gay silk socks were
admired and copied by all the young
members of the Cotton-Tail Club,
in Rabbitsville, where Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
lived.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>
<img src='images/i_014.jpg' alt='[Bunnies]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>He fell in love with a charming
little rabbit, Miss Primrose Featherball,
and after a short courtship, and
a very fine wedding, they settled down
in a beautiful cosy nest in a hollow
tree.</p>

<p class='c010'>When Mr. and Mrs. Bunnikins-Bunny
had been married about two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>years, they decided, for the sake of
Mr. Bunnikins’ health, to spend the
summer camping out in the mountains.</p>

<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i_016.jpg' alt='[Bunny]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>They had two nice little bunny
children. The elder was named Bobtail,
like his father, and the younger,
a dear soft mite of a
thing, was called Rosamund.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was a good little
bunny, and behaved like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>a small lady, while Bobtail
was a bunch of
mischief.</p>

<div  class='figright id006'>
<img src='images/i_017.jpg' alt='[Bunny]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>From morning till
night, he was always getting
into trouble of some
kind, until his mother
thought she should be
obliged either to send
him to boarding-school,
or else to keep him
chained to a tree.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>However, he had promised to be
very, very good if his father would
take him camping, and for a week
he had been on his best behavior.</p>

Mr. and Mrs. Bunnikins-Bunny
had invited their great friends
Mr. and Mrs. Gray-Squirrel and their
two children, Ruddy and Chippy, to
spend the summer with them; and
one beautiful morning they started
off, bright and early, for the mountains.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>
<img src='images/i_022.jpg' alt='[Bunny]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>They had a cart, drawn by Neddy,
a nice fat donkey, which the Gray-Squirrels
and the Bunnikins family
had loaded with all sorts of things
which they would need, and many
others which they would never want,
but which Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
had insisted on stuffing in. At the
last moment, he brought out a large
feather-bed, which he felt sure he
would need if he had rheumatism,
and a foot-bath for Rosamund, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>case she had the croup or whooping-cough.</p>

<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i_024.jpg' alt='[Donkey]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Bunnikins, however, refused,
quite sternly, to put another single
thing in the cart,
which was already
top-heavy, and
might tip over, or
else break down.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides, Neddy
was very particular,
and might lie
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>down on the way, if he thought the
load too big.</p>

<p class='c010'>Since his marriage Mr. Bunnikins
had become, not only more particular
than ever about his beautiful
clothes, but also very fussy about
himself, and was constantly imagining
that he had some new complaint.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had brought a fine silk hammock
to sleep in, when the nights
were warm, and a soft woolly sleeping-bag,
if it were cold. As for socks,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>hats, and fancy waistcoats, he would
have brought dozens, had not Mrs.
Bunnikins limited him
to half a dozen of each.</p>

<div  class='figright id006'>
<img src='images/i_026.jpg' alt='[Bunny]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Having had a cold
in one of his long ears,
he had tied his gray
felt hat, with its green
feathers, tightly down
under his chin.</p>

<p class='c010'>On his feet he wore
green-and-white striped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>socks, because he said they looked
spring-like, and his coat was green-and-white
striped linen, to match.</p>

<p class='c010'>He carried a green parasol to protect
his eyes from the sun, and on his
back was strapped a cunning little
knapsack.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_027.jpg' alt='[Knapsack Contents]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>In this he carried a bottle of Dr.
Possum’s “Ready Relief,” a
hair-brush, a small bottle of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>cayenne pepper, which by making
you sneeze would cure a cold; an
extra pair of socks; a smelling-bottle;
some toothpicks; half a dozen acorns
for luncheon; a pair of rubber shoes
to keep his toe-toes dry if it rained;
a piece of maple sugar for his little
Rosamund; a couple of cabbage-leaves
to put on his head if the sun
was too hot; and, lastly, a tiny folding
umbrella.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
<img src='images/i_029.jpg' alt='[Bunny]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>After a good many delays, they
finally started; but when they had
gone about a mile, Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
suddenly stopped, and insisted
that he had forgotten something
<i>most</i> important. What it was,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>he refused to tell, but back to the
house he <i>must</i> and would go.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well,” said patient Mrs.
Bunnikins-Bunny, “it is already so
late that we might as well have our
luncheon here. By the time you
come back, we shall be ready.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_030.jpg' alt='[Squirrel]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Then Mrs. Bunnikins and the
Gray-Squirrels unloaded the baskets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>and set the table for luncheon.</p>

<div  class='figright id006'>
<img src='images/i_031.jpg' alt='[Donkey]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The table was a nice flat stone,
and the table-cover was made of
pretty ferns and flowers, which the
little bunnies and
squirrels picked. Mr.
Neddy, the donkey,
had his dinner under
a shady tree, while
the others waited
patiently for Mr.
Bunnikins-Bunny.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Pretty soon they saw him in the
distance, puffing and panting along,
and dragging behind him some large
object. When he came nearer, his
wife saw that he was bringing a life-preserver.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My dear,” she
called, “what <i>can</i>
you want that for?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_032.jpg' alt='[Bunny]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>
<img src='images/i_033.jpg' alt='[Bunny]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“For Bobtail,” Mr. Bunnikins
shouted back. “If we <i>should</i> camp
near a pond, he would <i>surely</i> fall in,
and then, as he can’t swim, he
would be drowned, unless we had
a life-preserver.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But how can we carry it?”
protested his wife. “The cart is already
so full that Neddy can scarcely
pull it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh! I have thought all that
out,” replied Mr. Bunnikins. “We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>will hang it around Neddy’s neck,
where he can carry it easily, and it
will look quite ornamental.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They had soon finished their
luncheon of carrot and lettuce salad
and walnut pie, and after harnessing
the donkey into the cart, and persuading
him, much against his will,
to let them hang the life-preserver
around his neck, they started off
once more.</p>

Towards evening they came to
a pretty little grove, where
they decided to spend the night.</p>

<p class='c010'>The small bunnies and squirrels
gathered sticks for a camp-fire; Mrs.
Gray-Squirrel and Mrs. Bunny prepared
supper; while Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
and Mr. Gray-Squirrel gave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>Neddy his supper and unpacked the
cart; Mr. Gray-Squirrel doing most
of the work, while Mr. Bunny talked
and made suggestions.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a cunning little white
tent for the children and their
mothers, Mr. Gray-Squirrel preferring
to sleep in a tree, while Mr.
Bunnikins-Bunny decided to try his
new hammock, swung between two
strong bushes near the tent.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were all so tired out, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>soon after supper they went to bed.
The little bunnies and squirrels were
asleep in two minutes; and soon
after, Mr. Gray-Squirrel, warmly
covered up with his broad tail,
could be heard snoring away, up in
his tree.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Mr. Bunnikins climbed into his
fine silk hammock, stretched himself
out lazily, and was drowsily
thinking how comfortable he was,
when suddenly he felt a sharp sting
in one of his soft paws.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mosquitoes!” he growled, as he
drew his legs up under him, and
made himself into as small a bunch
as possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bzz,” “Bzz,”—and a sting on
the end of his long silky ear.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bzz,” “Bzz,”—another sting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>on the tip of his small pink nose.</p>

<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i_044.jpg' alt='[Bunny]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Poor Mr. Bunnikins twisted and
turned, trying to forget the mosquitoes,
and go to sleep; but it was
of no use. When morning came,
and the mosquitoes went, they left
in the hammock a very
tired and cross gentleman
rabbit. He told Mrs.
Bunnikins that he
had had too much of
camp-life and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>going home as soon as he had eaten
his breakfast.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no, my dear,” said his gentle
little wife, “you must not do that.
I have plenty of mosquito-netting,
and I can easily make you perfectly
comfortable.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At first Mr. Bunnikins utterly
refused to stay, but finally his friend
Gray-Squirrel persuaded him to try
one more night, and if the mosquitoes
still bothered him, they all promised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>to go home with him the following
morning.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<img src='images/i_046.jpg' alt='[Bunnies]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>All day Mrs. Bunnikins-Bunny
cut and sewed, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>before bedtime she had made her
husband a lovely pink mosquito-netting
nightgown.</p>

<div  class='figright id006'>
<img src='images/i_047.jpg' alt='[Bunnies]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It covered him
from the tips of his
ears to the very ends
of his toe-toes, and
when he was in his
hammock Mrs. Bunnikins
tied it up like
a bag below his paws,
so that not a single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>mosquito ever again had even a
taste of him.</p>

They traveled on for several
days up into the mountains,
and finally they came to a lovely
glade surrounded by shady trees,
with a pretty little brook close by.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is just the place to camp out
for the rest of the summer,” said
Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“See the nut-trees and clover-blossoms,”
said Mr. Gray-Squirrel,
who was fond of good things to eat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Bunnikins and Mrs. Gray-Squirrel
were pleased to have the
brook so near, where they could
wash both the children and the
clothes.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Not far away they found an old
deserted shed, which made an excellent
stable for Neddy; and in the
hollow of a tree, they made a cosy
nest for cold or rainy
weather.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hollow was so near
the ground, that, by making
a little ladder, the
Bunny family could
easily climb in.</p>

contented himself with scampering

<p class='c010'>The little Bunnies and Gray-Squirrels
loved to play in the brook,
and not far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>away they discovered a large pond.
There, however, they were forbidden
to go unless Neddy, the donkey,
and the life-preserver went with
them.</p>

One afternoon, Mr. Bunnikins
was taking half a dozen winks
in his hammock, when he
was suddenly awakened by the loud
squealing of Bobtail in the distance.</p>
<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
<img src='images/i_060.jpg' alt='[Bunny]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>He sprang up wide awake in a
moment, remembering that the
children had all gone to play at the
pond. Calling to Mr.
Gray-Squirrel to follow
him, Mr. Bunnikins
scampered through
the woods as
fast as
his four
fat and somewhat
gouty paws
could carry him.
When he reached the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>pond, he saw Neddy and Bobtail
trying vainly to throw the life-preserver
to a brown furry object
which was struggling in the water,
some little distance from shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come here, Neddy,” called Mr.
Bunnikins-Bunny, “and let me get
on your back; then you can swim
to whatever that is in the water,
and I can throw it the life-preserver,
when we get near enough.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hee-haw!” said Neddy, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>meant, “All right, sir”; and Mr.
Bunnikins scrambled up on his back,
with the life-preserver held tightly
in his fore paws, and off they swam.</p>

<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i_062.jpg' alt='[Bear]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>As soon as they came near the
struggling object, with all his might
and main, Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
threw the life-preserver.</p>

<p class='c010'>It landed
close to the
Furry One,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>who at once pulled himself on top
of it, and was safe, but alas for poor
Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny! He had
thrown the life-preserver so hard,
that he lost his
footing on Neddy’s
back, which
was wet and slippery,
and splish!
splash! splosh!
into the water
he fell.</p>

<div  class='figright id006'>
<img src='images/i_063.jpg' alt='[Wet Bunny]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>Neddy grabbed him quickly by
his long ears, and swam toward shore
with him, towing the life-preserver,
with the furry object on it, by a
rope.</p>

<p class='c010'>Such a wet, unhappy Bunnikins
as he was when Neddy put him
gently down on dry land! He hated
water anyhow, and never even wet
the ends of his pink toes if he could
help it. He kept his beautiful soft
fur as white as snow, but paddling
in the water he despised. His dignity,
besides, had been very much
hurt by his having been carried
out of the pond by his ears.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>

</div>

<p class='c010'>Meanwhile the brown furry object
had crawled off the life-preserver,
and waded ashore. Bobtail
and Ruddy Squirrel,
very much excited,
rushed up to him,
and asked who he
was, and how he happened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>to be in the water so far
from the land.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Furry One tried to tell them
how he had fallen off from a high
rock into deep water, and how he
had tried to swim to shore, but could
not. He was, however, so frightened
and confused that Ruddy and Bobtail
could not understand much
that he said.</p>

Just as they had told him that
he had better play with them
and get warm, a crackling of
bushes and the sound of some heavy
animal plunging through the underbrush
was heard, and a moment
later a huge brown bear lumbered
out of the woods and came snarling towards them.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id002'>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>
<img src='images/i_072.jpg' alt='[Bear &#38; Bunny]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“Where is my Brownie Cub
baby?” it growled to the terrified
Bunnies and Squirrels.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny, his teeth
chattering with cold and fright,
assured the Bear politely that he
did not know where his Brownie
Cub baby was, but he would let
him know if he met it anywhere
on his travels.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly the Bear caught sight of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>the Furry One, and with a loud yap
of joy he trotted heavily towards it.</p>

<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i_074.jpg' alt='[Bears]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>The little thing began to whimper
with evident delight,
and the big
bear, sitting up on
his haunches, lifted
the small brown
object in his huge
paws.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a few moments
the little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Brownie Cub had told his father
what dreadful things had happened
to him, and how brave Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
had been.</p>

<p class='c010'>The unhappy Bunnies and Squirrels
meanwhile sat quaking with
fright, not daring to move, and expecting
every moment to be gobbled
up by the terrible bear.</p>

<p class='c010'>Very soon, however, their fears
were relieved, for Mr. Brown Bruin,
with large tears bobbling down his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>cheeks, and in a husky voice, began
to thank Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny for
his heroic action.</p>

<div  class='figright id006'>
<img src='images/i_076.jpg' alt='[Bunny]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>When he saw how dripping wet
he was, he tried to lick him dry; but
when he opened his great red mouth,
he scared poor Bunnikins
nearly out of
his wits, and the first
lap of his huge rough
tongue knocked him
down, and pulled out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>bits of his soft fur.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he recovered his breath,
Mr. Bunnikins thanked Mr. Bruin
for his kindness, but he begged to
be excused from any more drying,
as, being subject to rheumatism, he
thought the wisest thing for him to
do was to go home very quickly,
and drink some ginger-and-cayenne-pepper
tea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mr. Bruin begged to be allowed
to call and see him the next day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and Mr. Bunnikins hurried home,
and was soon in bed, well wrapped
up in warm blankets, and sneezing
violently from the cayenne pepper.</p>

The next morning as Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny
was rather stiff
and chilly, Mrs. Bunnikins
insisted that he should lie in his
hammock in the sunshine, and be
very lazy.</p>

<p class='c010'>While she was talking to him, she
suddenly gave a terrified squeak,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>and started as fast as she could run
towards the hollow tree, fairly tumbling
up the little ladder, into the
safety of the nest.</p>

<p class='c010'>How Mr. Bunnikins-Bunny and
Mr. Gray-Squirrel laughed, when
they saw what had frightened her—just
Mr. and Mrs. Brown Bruin and
their three children, come to make
a pleasant morning call. They had
brought a big jar of golden honey
(the delight of bears) as a present
to Mr. Bunnikins, and a lot of ripe
nuts and wild celery for the children.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>They begged the Bunnies and
the Squirrels to come and make them
a visit very soon, Mr. Bruin offering
to carry them to and fro on his
broad back;
he even persuaded
Rosamund
to
take a little
ride with her father then and there.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>That evening at supper-time
Bobtail was missing, and for some
time he could not be found. Finally
Ruddy Squirrel spied him,
hidden away in the play-house near
the brook.</p>

<div  class='figleft id006'>
<img src='images/i_086.jpg' alt='[Bunnies]' class='ig001'>
</div>

<p class='c010'>When his father
pulled him out he
was a sorry-looking
bunny. He had
been told not to
touch the honey,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>but he was so anxious to have a
little taste, that he had tried to get
a pawful out of the bear’s big jar,
and, leaning over too far, he had
lost his balance and fallen in.</p>

<p class='c010'>From the tip of his ears to the
end of his short tail he was a mass
of sweet sticky honey, and when
Mr. Bunnikins took hold of him
to shake him, his paw stuck fast to
poor Benjamin’s long ear.</p>

<p class='c010'>The only thing to do was to soak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>him in the brook until the honey
melted out of his fur, which took
such a long time that Bobtail
caught a fearful cold, and did nothing
but cough and sneeze for a
week after.</p>

<p class='c010'>He ate no more honey for a long,
long time, and did not even like to
see it.</p>

The rest of the summer passed
very pleasantly. The Bunnies
and Squirrels made several
visits to their new friends the
Brown Bears, who had found a hollow
tree for them near their own
cave-house. In this tree the bears
built a beautiful nest, and made it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>so comfortable, that, when the time
came for the Bunnies and Squirrels
to go home for the winter, they
promised surely to return the following
summer.</p>

<p class='c010'>One pleasant autumn day the
tent was taken down, and with all
the other things was packed in the
cart. The life-preserver, however, was
given as a parting gift to Mr. Brown
Bruin, who was much pleased.
Neddy, the donkey, was thankful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>to get rid of it, as he hated to wear
it around his neck.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_093.jpg' alt='[Bears]' class='ig001'>

<p class='c010'>Neddy had grown so fat from
doing nothing all summer that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>could scarcely waddle, and Bobtail
declared he looked like a hippopotamus.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Bunnies and the Gray-Squirrels
felt very sad to leave their kind
friends the Brown Bears, and the
pretty camp with its running brook,
but winter was coming and soon the
nights would be cold so far up in
the mountains.</p>

<p class='c010'>They reached home after several
days of travel, without any accident,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>excepting that several times Neddy
insisted on lying down in the road
and taking naps.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Gray-Squirrels said good-bye
to the Bunnies, as they lived

they all settled down comfortably
in their warm winter nests.</p>
